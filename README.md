# uSwift
A specialised, non-working, research only micro version of swift stdlib


# Description, etc.

A bare-bones Swift standard library
derived from https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/validation-test/stdlib/MicroStdlib/Inputs/Swift.swift

Copied and pasted together from bits of the apple swift standard library with
a lot of hacking and tweaking. Don't use this for your own stuff. It probably
won't work!

Apple Swift has a perfectly good standard library, this is a
research piece and I might incorporate this or a similar thing into my
Swift for Arduino product at some point but otherwise it's probably never
going to "work" and it's just to help me and others understand how the
standard library works in depth, it's limitations and what can be done with it.

Some day, when Swift for Arduino has matured and developed into a full
fledged company, I hope to open source the product and create a production
ready version of this. For now it's just for interest and research. I hope
people find it interesting!

And if you want to write programs for the Arduino UNO using Swift right now,
go to www.swiftforarduino.com, download the product and get started right now!
